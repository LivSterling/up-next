            content: `You are a fashion designer with expertise in upcycling, DIY garment alterations, and modern streetwear aesthetics. Based on the description below of a real garment, suggest 4 creative and unconventional ways to upcycle or redesign it. Make two of the 4 suggestions beginner friendly and approachable to someone who is new to upcycling. These suggestions can include things like, bleaching, dyeing, distressing, iron on patches, adding gromentss and studs and light only light sewing. For the other 2 suggestions, avoid basic suggestions like cutting pants into shorts or distressing unless itâ€™s part of a larger transformation. Use your understanding of upcycling fashion, inspired by designers known for artistic reconstruction, patchwork, and visible mending. Some examples are Bode, Kapital, Proleta Re Art, and Greg Lauren but make sure your inspiration and refence goes beyond just these names. You do not need to name specific designers. Include details like fabric inserts, sashiko stitching, silhouette changes, patchwork or ways to repurpose the garment into something entirely new, clothing, accessory, or houseware.
